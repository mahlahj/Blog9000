GbuCOBOL adds some interesting colorization opportunities!

The paradigm for COBOL, however, remains buffered. From IBM's LU2.s, to GNU, we need to treat the screen as a ”send it and share it” set-of display strings.

The [WS_COLORS.cpy]( https://github.com/soft9000/Blog9000/blob/master/GnuCOBOL/SCREEN/WS_COLORS.cpy) copy book will jump start an interesting colorization.

The [TreeGet.py](https://github.com/soft9000/Blog9000/blob/master/GnuCOBOL/SCREEN/TreeGet.py) file demonstrates how to use a modern scripting language to generate a screen.

Decidedly seasonal, I'd hope to invite you to compile and -j run "[CHRISTMAS_2021.cob](https://github.com/soft9000/Blog9000/blob/master/GnuCOBOL/SCREEN/CHRISTMAS_2021.cob)."  Maybe even visit the [asciiart.website]( https://asciiart.website/index.php?art=holiday/christmas/trees) and see what you might be able to “PyBol” together?
